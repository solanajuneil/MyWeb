    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Yoasobi (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese music superduo 
    formed by Sony Music Entertainment Japan, composed of Vocaloid 
    producer Ayase [ja], and singer-songwriter Ikura [ja].
    Represented by the slogan "novel into music", 
    the duo has released songs based on novels posted on Monogatary.com [ja], 
    a novel-centered social media operated by their label, which is also from various media like novels written by professional authors, books, letters, and plays.</p>

    <p>after going viral on social media, Yoasobi's debut single, "Yoru ni Kakeru", gave them their breakthrough by reaching atop the Billboard Japan Hot 100 for six non-consecutive weeks and the 2020 year-end chart, and becoming the first song to be certified diamond for streaming by Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). It was followed by other successful singles, such as Blue Period-inspired "Gunjō", and anime series themes "Kaibutsu" for Beastars, "Shukufuku" for Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury and "Idol" for Oshi no Ko. In 2022, the duo collaborated with novelists–Rio Shimamoto, Mizuki Tsujimura, Miyuki Miyabe, and Eto Mori–released the short story collection Hajimete no, and performed the songs based on its stories.</p>
